            <h2>"How Mobile Networks Work: The Science Behind Calls, Data, and 5G Connectivity</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Mobile networks enable calls and data through cellular architecture, dividing regions into cells served by base stations that manage radio waves (600 MHz to 100 GHz) for coverage and speed. Voice/data signals are digitized, modulated (e.g., QAM), and routed via circuit or packet switching—modern systems like 5G prioritize packet-based VoLTE for efficiency. Core infrastructure (MSC, gateways) authenticates users and routes traffic, while evolving standards—1G (analog) to 5G (mmWave, beamforming, ultra-low latency)—boost speed and capacity. Challenges like signal interference are countered with repeaters, MIMO, and error correction. Encryption (AES) and SIM authentication secure communications, while satellites and IoT integration expand connectivity. Emerging 6G and terahertz tech promise faster, AI-driven networks.

            <h2>Smart Fire Alert</h2>
            <p class="description">
                The Arduino-based Fire Alert System is designed to detect fire or smoke in your home and immediately notify the house owner via SMS. Using a flame or smoke sensor, the system continuously monitors for any signs of a fire. Once detected, the system triggers an alarm by sounding a buzzer and flashing an LED for immediate attention. At the same time, it sends a real-time SMS message to the homeowner, providing crucial information about the emergency situation. This system ensures that you’re always alerted in case of a fire, even when you're away from home, offering an extra layer of safety for your family and property.
